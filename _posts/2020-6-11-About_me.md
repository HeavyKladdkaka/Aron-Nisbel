I have two passions, the first being UX-Design and the second is solving code-related problems preferably in a full-stack environment. I like to converse with people about usability, iterating my way forward through user-testing to figure out how to improve. You would find me thriving in a team of people working towards a common goal. I am talkative and I do love random facts. If you know one, please let me know ASAP.

On my free time I like to travel the world to search for majestic cliffs and boulders to climb, at least when there is nice weather. When the weather is less desirable, I love to run in the rain when the air is fresh, usually sticking to the longer running distances. When I'm not excercising I can sit by my computer for hours on end, either gaming or creating games.
