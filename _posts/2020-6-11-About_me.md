I have two passions, the first being UX-Design and the second is solving code-related problems preferably in a full-stack environment. I like to converse with people about usability, iterating my way forward through user-testing to figure out how to improve. You would find me thriving in a team of people working towards a common goal. </p>

Ever since I started programming and learning to design at the University, my inner excitement triggers everytime I see any type of code or design related problem. Hours go by, and I sometimes forget to eat and drink. To me, it's all about the creativity it takes to create a solution and the instant happiness when you finally solve it. Then, to be able to look at that app, website, design, or game and say; 
<blockquote>I made that.</blockquote>
But the best part is to be able to say it together with a team of amazing and ambitious people. 
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>We made that.</blockquote>
And to be able to share the experience and talk about the solutions and all the obstacles we bumped in to along the way, that is the main reason why I love this.

In my free time, I like to travel the world in search of majestic cliffs and boulders to climb, at least when the weather is nice. When the weather is less desirable, I love to run in the rain when the air is fresh, usually sticking to the longer running distances. When I'm not exercising I can sit by my computer for hours on end,  either coding, designing, gaming or creating games.
