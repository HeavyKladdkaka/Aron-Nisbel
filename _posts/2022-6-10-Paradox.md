Worked directly with Paradox Development Studio (PDS), a Swedish game studio and the creators of Grand Strategy Games (GSGs) like Stellaris, Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, and Hearts of Iron, et al.

<ul>
	<li>Investigated the feasibility of “one User Interface to rule them all” when creating GSGs for both PC and consoles.</li>
	<li>Extensive quantitative research was conducted with a 400 question survey that generated 864 submissions from players across 12 different strategy games on consoles.</li>
	<li>The Pace was found to have the biggest impact on the User Experience (UX) of strategy games on consoles. To evaluate the Pace further, qualitative playtests of 2 of the games used in the survey were conducted.</li>
	<li> Worked closely with the UX team and the engine team of PDS to discuss and iterate on solutions for the UX and UI design of GSGs on consoles with my user research as the basis.
My research is now directly in use by the teams.</li>
</ul>
